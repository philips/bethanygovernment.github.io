title: Street Trees
---

Street trees have been required for all new development in urban unincorporated Washington County since 1983--which means all development in Bethany (urban areas north of West Union to the county line and between CornPass and the county line to the east) should have street trees planted.

Unfortunately, although street trees are required to be planted, I don't believe there are any rules to protect the trees.  Root damage to sidewalks has been an ongoing problem in Bethany.  In a recent conversation I had with Washington County staff, I learned that root barriers are now being required in an attempt to limit tree root damage to paved surfaces.  I'm not sure when this requirement was put into place and I assumed the barrier is intended to protect both the roadway and sidewalks.

My guess is that most sidewalk damage is caused by trees that are watered by sprinklers, with the sprinklers encouraging roots to remain at the surface.

On my walk today, I specifically looked for cases of street trees vs. sidewalks.  Along Wendy Lane between Kaiser and 146th Avenue, at least 80% of the street trees no longer exist.  On Sethrich Lane between Kaiser and 146th Ave, sidewalks have been replaced and to accommodate the sidewalk, the roots have been trimmed in the planter strip as if they were a hedge.

I'm hopeful the Treekeepers group is going to work with the county to help provide needed protections for the long-term health of street trees.
